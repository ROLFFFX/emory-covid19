          The ways in which this dynamic epidemic will interact with county contextual factors and impact Americans in coming months (and years) are poorly understood. 
          Early data suggest that population density, area-level poverty, residential segregation, underlying population health status (especially chronic comorbidity), and availability of services (especially testing coverage and primary care density) are associated with the geographical distribution of COVID-19â€”but these associations are not monotonic nor are they meaningful in isolation. 
          Given the vast heterogeneity in social, demographic, and economic domains within and across US communities, a formidable challenge for public health actors will be responding to the epidemic in a manner that takes contextual factors into account and assures health equity among all Americans.<br/>
          The experience with COVID-19 thus far indicates that previously existing public health infrastructure and data tracking systems were ill-prepared to dynamically collect and synthesize data for tailored response. 
          For example, despite the early data indicating that area-level deprivation was associated with higher COVID-19 case fatality and mortality (per capita deaths), there is little guidance regarding how to critically incorporate the role of social determinants into the public health response to the epidemic. 
          In particular, a coherent, easy-to-use, and actionable integration of COVID-19 epidemiologic data with county context is lacking.
